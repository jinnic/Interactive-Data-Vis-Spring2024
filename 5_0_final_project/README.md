# Final project
The goals for this tutorial are:

- Creating a data visualization that gives your users the ability to explore or understand the MoMA collection dataset of artwork and artists. 
- The data can be found on github here: [https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection](https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection.).

## Deliverables 
- Prospectus: cleaned and organized notes after ideation class session.

- Sketches: cleaned and organized drawings after prototyping class session.
Final project: a live, working site with data visualizations that satisfy the project requirements.

## Requirements
MoMA dataset is leveraged in some capacity. All data presented should be factual (as well as any analysis or manipulations), and data sources should be referenced.

The page is live, accessible, and the visualization loads properly. The page should include other aspects of a webpage, such as a heading, context, basic structure, etc. 

The webpage uses d3.js and/or mapbox for one or more visualizations. You can use any of the tutorial visualizations or expand to other uses of d3.js. You may include other visualization libraries if it helps articulating your research, but you must use d3.js or mapbox in some capacity.
